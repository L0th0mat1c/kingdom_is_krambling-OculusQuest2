Once you consider your branch ready to be merged, create a new MR and assign your lead for a review.

If your MR does not meet the requirements above, they will not be merged and comments will be added for you to fix the line/file concerned. The easiest way to fix the issue is to checkout the concerned branch, commit your fix and push.
